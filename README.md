### Police Contraband Searches



The aim of the work was to build a model to fairly predict if a vehicle that is stopped by a police officer has or not contraband, so the police officer has a sustained decision to look for contraband or not.

The mocdl would need to satisfy the following requirements:

> A minimum precision of 50% (when a car is searched, it should be at least 50% likely that contraband is found).

> The precision discrepancy should not be bigger than 5% between the protected classes (race, ethnicity, gender).

> The largest possible amount of contraband found, given the constraints above.
